Chess is a game played by over 700 million people around the world. Chess game matches can take various forms depending on the users desired setting. I will design and simulate (Multisim) three down counter clocks that will undertake the sequence of falling numbers. The clocks are to be used for a game of blitz chess, a game in which the players will each have a clock with specified time to make a move or forfeit the game if the clock time runs out. The third clock will have the match time, in which If the timer expires, the game will end in a tie. The purpose for the project is to design down counters that can be used at different settings, appropriate to the chess players desired setting.
