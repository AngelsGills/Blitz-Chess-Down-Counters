Chess is a game played by over 700 million people around the world. Chess game matches can take various forms depending on the user's desired setting. The project covers the design and simulation (Multisim) of counter clocks that will undertake the sequence of rising/falling numbers. The clocks are to be used for a game of blitz chess, a game in which the players will each have a clock with specified time to make a move or forfeit the game if the clock time runs out (hypothetically) . The third clock will have the match time, in which If the timer expires, the game will end in a tie (also hypothetically). The purpose for the project is to design counters that can be used at different settings, appropriate to the chess players desired setting.
